# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Repository for Assignments
## for assessment January 2022
***

This repository contains my submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics.

## Contents of repository:

### 1. Readme file
Brief summary of repository contents and how to download and run the contents
### 2. Topic Notebooks x 5
Jupyter notebooks for each of the five topics covered in this module and the exercises assigned weekly therein
### 3. Normal Distribution Notebook
A notebook about the normal distribution, defining and explaining the main concepts, pitched at my peers with accompanying visuals
### 4. git ignore
Files to be ignored when commits are made to this repository

## About the notebooks
Python 3 was used to develop this project and is needed to run the code in the notebook. Python 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or using the Anaconda Python distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.


Each Jupyter Notebook can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser without Python 3 being installed. If the repository is downloaded it can be run locally by navigating to the folder and entering the command jupyter notebook on the command line. This will open Jupyter in the browser. 

The main python libraries used are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy. These are loaded at the start of the code. The code should be run from top to bottom in each notebook. 

## How to clone this repository

On GitHub at https://github.com/Scunnies/PfDA_Assignment click the green Code button, copy the URL for the repository. Open Git Bash, change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory, type git clone, and then paste the URL. Press Enter to create your local clone.

## References 

Some resources are hyperlinked within the text of the notebooks, appended to the relevant section and the remainder of references are listed at the end of the notebooks.
